The original Research Questions presented in the Problem Statement do not 
represent the structure and goals of this thesis anymore. Thus I decided to 
change them. Reasons:

 - The original idea was to dedicate the second half of this thesis to an 
   economical analysis of the business concept. However it was found out that 
   the scope of the technical part is larger than anticipated. The focus 
   should be there and thus the economical & business parts are officially cut 
   from the thesis.
 - The usability parts have become relevant enough to us where it is now 
   feasible to dedicate an entire section of this thesis to them

Here are the new refined research questions:

 - RQ1: What are the technological bottlenecks in a software system that uses 
   Computer Vision algorithms and Object recognition together with an Augmented 
   Reality User Interface?
 - RQ2: Can such a system provide satisfactory user experience?
 - RQ3a: Could such a system be used as an educational tool?
 - RQ3b: If such a system can be used as an educational tool, how does it 
   perform compared to other education methods?
