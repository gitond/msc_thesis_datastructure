This is a git repo containing my (Botond Ortutay) MSC thesis data structure for easier synchronization between different computers as well as version control.

It includes the thesis, all the files needed to generate it, all the preparatory work done for it and some downloaded academic sources. In short: the entire datastructure.

The thesis is based on the template available at https://gitlab.utu.fi/ttweb/thesis

I don't own, or claim to own the template copyright.

In order to correctly compile the .tex files into .pdf on a basic Fedora install, certain dependencies need to be installed. Underneath you'll find the list of dependencies. I've also configured a makefile that should compile and render all the files into a thesis without any problems.

Dependencies: texlive-latex.noarch texlive-adjustbox.noarch texlive-babel-finnish.noarch texlive-pdfx.noarch texlive-nomencl.noarch texlive-biblatex-ieee.noarch texlive-fvextra.noarch texlive-datetime2.noarch texlive-datetime2-finnish.noarch texlive-enumitem.noarch texlive-algorithmicx.noarch
