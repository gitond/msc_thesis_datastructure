Topic: 3.5. On Client-Server Architecture in AR Applications
Justification: An actual example of somebody designing a system with an AR frontend and dataprocessing happening in the background. Even though it is not an exact match of what we want to do (middleware based approach), it's probably worthe mentioning.
Potential issues: Old, Conference paper

Topic: 3.4.2. AR Software, 4.3. Proposed Architecture
Justification: This is basically a description of a development tool (with performance benchmarks). This is one potential tool we can use to actually build the thing. Furthermore it has an overview of AR-app development & it's recent.
Potential issues: ---

Topic: 3.5. On Client-Server Architecture in AR Applications, 4.2. Perceived Challenges, 4.3. Proposed Architecture
Justification: Their architecture is quite different from what we want (focus on edge computing & robotics; still very much worth studying in 4.3.), however their benchmarks are beautiful and should absolutely influence 4.2. Furthermore this is really high quality work and very cutting edge too (from this year).
Potential issues: ---

Topic: 2. Detailed Problem Description, 4.1. Problem Description
Justification: This article is about looking at a multitude of real-world problems and based on these problems' unique characteristcs suggesting potential cloud AR-architectures. Also one of the considered problems is training in the medical field.
Potential issues: The overwhelming focus on multiuser and edge computing means that the architectures described here are not the best fit for our specific problems.

Topic: 3.1. Client-Server Architectures
Justification: Discusses web/cloud development from an AR perspective
Potential issues: Relevance, Quality, Age

Topic: 2. Detailed Problem Description, 4.1. Problem Description, 4.3. Proposed Architecture
Justification: This article basically discusses whether or not integrating cloud features in an AR mobile app is worth it or not. 
Potential issues: This might include a lot of relevant insights or it might not. I couldn't decide by reading the abstract and scrolling through the article. The work itself appears high quality and it "borders" relativity to this project. However it's also quite old and might be outdated.

Topic: 3.2. Computer Vision (CV)
Justification: I still don't have any sources on computer vision and this article looks like it provides an overview
Potential issues: Quality. Although this article claims to be written to review the usage of CV in AR applications, the part on AR is so short it's basically negligable.

Topic: 3.2. Computer Vision (CV), 3.4. Augumented Reality (AR)
Justification: This is a source that claims to cover both CV, AR and their ability to work together. If this is true AND the quality is high enought, than this is exactly the kind of source this literature cover aims to uncover
Potential issues: Preprint, short, possible quality issues

Topic: 3.2. Computer Vision (CV), 3.3. Client-Server Architecture with AI Integration, 3.4. Augumented Reality (AR)
Justification: This discusses exactly the topics I want CV, AR, how they work together. It even seems to touch on running these on a server. Furthermore it seems to be very high quality and could be used as a basis for snowballing.
Potential issues: Literature review. Also: kinda old (2022)

Topic: 3.2. Computer Vision (CV), 3.4. Augumented Reality (AR)
Justification: Best source on building an AR app with CV technology underneath. Also provides technical examples.
