\section{(Our Prototype: Need and User-perspective)} \label{nUPers}

%%% PURPOSE OF THE PROTOTYPE & RESEARCH MOTIVATION

% Justication for RQ2 should be included in this chapter
%%%
% RQ2: Can a system with a backend computer vision system and an AR user 
% interface be used in a cooking environment?
%%%
In order to empirically examine the use of an AR application with a modern CV 
and DL-based tracking solution in a cooking environment, as defined in 
\hyperref[rq2]{\textbf{RQ2}}, a suitable prototype needs to be developed. In 
this chapter we aim to define this prototype: exactly what it'll need to do and 
what kind of challenges we might face during development. \par

%%% USER-PERSPECTIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION

%TODO: Write clear text for the following bullet points:
% - High-level description of the application as a user would encounter it.
% - “An AR application which guides the user through the preparation of a fruit salad.”



%%%
% - Goal: offer \textbf{real-time} guidance for \textbf{actions} involved in
%   making the dish
%   - adding ingredients to pots, handling kitchen appliances, peeling and 
%     chopping ingredients
%   - These actions as AR-annotations (animations)
%%%
	This application would offer real-time guidance for all of the actions 
involved in making the fruit salad as defined in listing \ref{recipelisting}, 
such as adding ingredients to pots, handling kitchen appliances, peeling and 
chopping ingredients. AR-augmentations, such as animations and interface 
elements, would guide the user through each of the actions involved. \par
%%%
% - Similar step-by-step approach as other prototypes in the education field
%   - pylvanainen, reyesEtAl2016: step-by-step instrument teaching tutorial 
%     approach
%%%
%TODO: Reword this section to better fit new structure
	A similar approach of using AR-augmentations in guiding the user 
through a sequence of actions one step at a time is present in several of the 
prototypes described in \ref{protos}. Both \textcite{pylvanainen} and 
\textcite{reyesEtAl2016} use this kind of approach to teach instrument use in 
laboratories, but their applications use traditional tracking methods that 
are developed for their specific instruments.



%TODO: Write clear text for the following bullet point:
% - Emphasize: user interaction is passive—camera + system guidance only.

%TODO: Write clear text AND/OR write a diagram for the following bullet point:
% - Describe end-to-end usage flow from user POV.



\section{How Technical Challenges Affected Prototype Development} \label{devChallenges}

%TODO: Write clear text for the following bullet point:
% - Challenge 1: What to track



%%%
% - Case for using CV in tracking: lots of things to track
%   - Ingredients
%     - These have different states
%   - Different kitchenware
%     - bowl, knives
%%%
There is a case to be made here for using more advanced CV and DL-based 
methods for tracking. Most obvious among these is the simple fact that there 
are lots of things to track. Just in the case of our simple fruit salad, one 
needs to track several different ingredients, which physically change shape as 
they are chopped into pieces during the preparation process. On top of the 
ingredients, different kitchenware such as a bowl and at least one knife needs 
to be tracked. It is pretty clear that such an application with this many 
different trackable objects and changing states would be extremely difficult 
to implement using traditional AR tracking methodologies, thus CV and DL need 
to be used. \par
