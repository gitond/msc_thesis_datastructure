\chapter{Background    (IF NOT COVERED BY 1.1)} \label{bg}
\textbf{Notes:}\\ 
\begin{itemize}
	\item This may be in 1.1 or as a separate chapter (2)

	\item Right now it is written as a separate chapter, decide precise 
	datastructure later.

	\item The purpose of the background is to justify the research 
	questions!
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Phases described in \#8 :
		\begin{itemize}
			\item RQ1 answered by phases 1 \& 2 (chapters 3,4,5)
			\item RQ2 has to be considered in phase 2 (chapters 4 
			\& 5) but is only fully answered in phase 3 (chapters 6 
			\& 7) 
			\item RQ3 is answered by phase 3 (chapters 6 \& 7)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Tasks:}\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a more in depth ``skeleton'' of the bg chapter

	\item identify, look at, take notes \& read through sources you need 
	for this chapter

	\item Write the chapter
\end{itemize}
