Research to-do:
 - "Cloud computing based mobile augmented reality interactive system": examine for project fit
 - 'Indocyanine Green Drives Computer Vision Based 3D Augmented Reality Robot Assisted Partial Nephrectomy: The Beginning of “Automatic” Overlapping Era': examine for project fit. **NOTE**: this publication has a video atteached to it.
 - Take a look at the book "Computer vision: algorithms and applications" by Richard Szeliski. It should be available in the university library (Teutori). Decide if it's relevant or not.
 - "Computer Vision Mobile System for Education Using Augmented Reality Technology": download & examine for project fit
 - **When doing the usability part**: May use article "Examining User Experience in an Augmented Reality
Adventure Game: Case Luostarinmäki Handicrafts Museum" for reference
- <mark>This list shouldn't be expanded further at this moment</mark>

Writing to-do:
 - **IMPORTANT**: <mark>START</mark> Ch.1 Introduction ("unripe" version, (kinda looks ready but to be edited in the future))
 - **IMPORTANT**: <mark>DRAFT</mark> the very first prototype version of Ch.1.3 Methodology overview
 - **IMPORTANT**: <mark>PREPARE</mark> "unripe" version  of Background (this may be in 1.1 or as a separate chapter (2))

Literature review:
 - *SEMI-IMPORTANT*: choose at least a few articles **from** <mark>preliminary references</mark> & <mark>research to-do</mark> as high priority sources (at least 11-15; try to look at other topics too (architecture, AI/CV, AR)), mark these somehow (could move to Bibliographia.bib already) and start literature review from these
 - *SEMI-IMPORTANT*: for all high priority sources: read and take notes.

Additional sources needed:
 - Additional sources: 3.3. Client-Server Architecture with AI Integration
 - Additional sources on AR tracking, (How do AR solutions find real-world subject they want to augument information onto? How does this link to AI-based computer vision systems?; Search terms: Tracking, tracking methods, tracking systems, augumented reality AND Computer vision)

Development to-do:
 - Quickly familiarize yourself with ARKit/ARCore
 - **IMPORTANT**: <mark>FIGURE OUT</mark> how the latex command `\listofaccronyms` works

Structural changes:

Notes:
 - On "half relevant" articles: Do they include data (especially UX-data) you could use?
