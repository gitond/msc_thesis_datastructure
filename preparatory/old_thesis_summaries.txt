Writer: Laura Jones
Link: https://www.utupub.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/152937/Virtual_Reality_in_Finnish_and_British_Museums_A_study_into_its_use_role_effectiveness_and_potential.pdf
Research Questions:
	- What has Virtual Reality technology (VR) been used for in the current decades?
	- What is the role and place of VR in museums currently?
	- How did VR become a part of museums' repertoire?
	- What is the ideal use of VR in the conext of museums?
	- Will the use of VR evolve in the future?
	- How effective is the usage of VR in museums?
	- How is VR being used in museums and what are some examples of this currently in use in the UK & Finland?
	- How is VR use in museums being influenced by museum size and resource availability?
	- Has the use of VR has increased the visitors in numbers, created more revenue, or resulted into positive feedback for the museums?
	- How has VR lead to partnerships between museums and technology companies?
Research Methodologies:
	- Literature review
		- academic materials, scientific articles
			- Of different fields also where applicable (VR was a new enough field in 2021 whan this was published that there wasn't always relevant material available)
		- research done by the museums themselves on this topic
	- Own research
		- talking with museum representatives
		- data obtained through observations, lectures, seminars, informal talks, questionnaires, documents, artefacts
			- some of these "personal in nature"
	- Qualitative research
	- Focus on specific museums due to willingness to cooperate & available resources
		- Victoria & Albert Museum
		- National Museum of Finland
		- Helsinki City Museum

Title: Attitude Processes and User Experiences in Virtual Reality Simulations : Attitude Transitions in Immersive and Non-Virtualized Virtual Reality Machine Gun Simulators
Writer: Fairuz Ishrat Bhuiyan
Link: https://www.utupub.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/178653/Bhuiyan_Fairuz_UTU-Diplomityo-Thesis.pdf
Research Questions:
	- How does a virtual reality (VR) based simulation affect the user?
	- How immersed do VR simulatos users become in the virtual world?
	- Are conscripts that perform better with a VR based anti-air machine gun simulator more suited for anti-aircraft duties?
	- Is simulation based training the best option to prepare conscripts for real battle scenarios?
	- Is VR-based simulation more immersive than traditional simulation?
	- Does VR-based simulation lead to better performance than traditional simulation?
	- Will the conscripts training on both traditional and VR-based simulators find them different in terms of usability and training performance?
	- Will conscripts that recieved more training with an assault rifle perform better in anti-aircraft machine gun simulation?
	- Do high immersive tendencies lead to users becoming more absorbed into simulation?
	- Does the VR-based simulator have a less heavy workload than a traditional simulator?
	- Will the subjects be more emotially immersed in the VR simulator than the traditional simulator?
	- Will the subjects feel psychological and physiological differences between the VR and the traditional simulators?
	- Will the subjects' sense of presence will be more intense in the VR simulation than in the traditional simulator?
	- Are the subjects' immersive tendency score and performance related to a high sense of presence in the VR simulation?
	- Do the users of the VR simulator get more simulation sickness symptoms than users of the traditional simulator?
Research Methodologies:
	- Researching with human subjects
		- Two groups
			- Different amounts of training (time)
			- Both groups train with & without simulators
			- Both simulators have the same aim (train soldiers in shooting down helicopters in a 5 min simulator window)
			- Group A
				- classical assault rifle simulator gun
			- Group B
				- VR based anti-aircraft machine gun simulator
			- Groups compared, analyzed
	- Measured factors

	- Measurement tools
		- Presence Questionnaire (PQ) measuring the subjects' sense of presence in a virtual environment
			- Based on a review of existing literature
		- Immersive Tendencies Questionnaire (ITQ) measuring the subjects' tendency to get immersed in situations
			- Designed to identify individual differences
		- Empatica E4 wristband
			- used to measure: electrical conductivity of skin, heart rate, temperature, acceleration of hand movement
	- Collected data
		- Background information
			- Age, gender, military rank, military unit
			- Gaming experience. Especially: VR, shooter games
			- Individual differences in personality & media usage
			- Immersive tendencies
		- On the experience with the simulators
			- Performance in simulator
			- NASA Task Load Index
			- Subjective User Experiences
			- Simulator Sickness
			- Presence
