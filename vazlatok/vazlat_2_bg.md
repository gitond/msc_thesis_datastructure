# 2 Background

## (2.1 Justification for RQ1 (come up with a better title later))

RQ1: technological challenges in combining CV & AR
 - Introduce CV & AR
 - Why do we want to combine these techs?
   - Traditional AR tracking: built to detect specific things in environment; 
     CV: larger computer model used for image analysis could theoretically be 
     used to perform this task
     - Solves some problems but creates others
       - This is what we aim to map out

## (2.2 AR in a nutshell (come up with a better title later))
