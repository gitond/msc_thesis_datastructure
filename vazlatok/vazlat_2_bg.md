RQ1: technological challenges in combining CV & AR
 - Introduce CV & AR
 - Why do we want to combine these techs?
   - Traditional AR tracking: built to detect specific things in environment; 
     CV: larger computer model used for image analysis could theoretically be 
     used to perform this task
     - Solves some problems but creates others
       - This is what we aim to map out

RQ2: can such a system be used in cooking?
 - Goal: build a demo system thet uses CV with AR
   - Why cooking?
     - AR could make the task easier
     - CV: lots of things to track (ingredients, pots, knives etc)

RQ3: user experience
 - Why measure user experience?
   - We want to demo the usefulness of these two techs working together
     - An app can only be useful if it's used
       - An app will only ever be used if it has good UX
