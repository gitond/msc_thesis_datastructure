# 4 Architecture description

## 4.1 Problem description

Justication for RQ2 should be included in this chapter
RQ2: can such a system be used in cooking?
 - Goal: build a demo system thet uses CV with AR
Prototype goals. We would like to create a prototype where
 - The prototype guides the user through a simple recipe and provides AR annotated instructions for each step
Example: Bolognese recipe
 - Goal: offer **real-time** guidance for **actions** involved in making the dish
   - adding ingredients to pots, handling kitchen appliances, peeling and chopping ingredients, waiting for cooking times
   - These actions as AR-annotations (animations)
 - Case for using CV in tracking: lots of things to track
   - Ingredients
     - Onion, meat, tomato sauce etc
       - These have different states
   - Different kitchenware
     - Pot for pasta, pan for sauce
   - Kitchen appliances
     - stovetop
       - with settings (heat on high, medium, etc)
Why cooking?
 - Real world problem where CV with AR could be useful.
 - Similar step-by-step approach as other prototypes in the education field
   - pylvanainen, reyesEtAl2016: step-by-step instrument teaching tutorial approach
 - If the end product here is successful the general approach could be adapted to different fields

## 4.2 Perceived Challenges 

 - Do this based on 3
 - Mention challenges encountered by others possible solutions if needed
 - Add as many subsections as needed

## 4.3 Proposed Architecture
